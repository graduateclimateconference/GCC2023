# Transportation

We will provide transportation between Boston and Woods Hole, but we can only ensure transport for you if you are attending the entire conference. Unless you choose to drive yourself, you will be taking a bus from MIT’s campus to MBL, which should take about 1h 45min.

Driving directions:
Participants who are driving to the conference should proceed directly to the MBL Swope Center for conference registration. You can enter 7 MBL Street, Woods Hole MA 02543 on the GPS. Please plan to arrive no later than 5:00 pm on Thursday, November 7. MBL parking permits must be requested upon registration.


We will be using Boston Corporate Coach buses: MIT pickup/drop-off outside the Visual Arts Center (20 Ames St, Cambridge, MA 02142). Logan Airport pickup/drop-off will be at the "charter buses" pick-up zone for each terminal. This is typically outside of the baggage claim area. For example, it's to the left at terminal B and the right at terminal E. Schedule Updated as of 10/13/2023.

# How to get to MIT’s campus for the bus
You can take a cab from Boston Logan Airport or the South Station train/bus terminal, which will cost about $40 and take 20-30 minutes in all cases. Uber and Lyft can be slightly cheaper, depending on demand. If you are planning to take a cab or Uber/Lyft from Boston Logan Airport to MIT and would like to coordinate shared rides with other attendees, please enter your information on the spreadsheet link provided in the final logistics email and use the sheet to contact other attendees.

Alternatively, you can take the MBTA (referred to as the “T”) which includes the subway, bus and commuter rail system in Boston. The OpenMBTA smartphone app is a great way to track bus/subway arrival and departure times when using public transportation in Boston. The MIT campus is located at the Kendall/MIT stop on the Red Line of the subway system.

<h4> How to get from Boston Logan Airport to MIT using the T: </h4>
The best way to get to MIT from the airport is to catch the free Silver Line bus from outside the lower level (baggage claim) of each terminal. This bus provides a free transfer into the subway system at South Station, from which point you can catch the Red Line to Kendall/MIT (look for the Inbound train in the direction of Alewife, exit four stops later). Plan at least an hour to get from Boston Logan Airport to MIT’s campus on the silver and red lines.

<h4> How to get from the South Station bus/train terminals to MIT using the T: </h4>
Those arriving via train or bus will have to purchase a farecard (<3$) to board the Red Line subway at South Station (look for the Inbound train in the direction of Alewife). Get off four stops later at the Kendall/MIT station. Budget half an hour to get from South Station to MIT’s campus.

If you choose to stay at MBL, you will be sharing a dorm room with another GCC participant, unless you paid extra for a private room through MBL’s website (approx. 213$ total for 3 nights). The private rooms have their own bathrooms, but none of the rooms have a fridge or microwave.

Towels and bedding will be provided. Meals will be served upstairs on the 2nd floor in Swope.
