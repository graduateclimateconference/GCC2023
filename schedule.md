### [Oral Presentation and Poster Abstracts Booklet (link)](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC_2023_Abstracts_Booklet.pdf)


#### Oral Presentations
As a reminder, your talk should be aimed at a general audience, as there will be graduate students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds attending.

Please keep your oral presentation between 10-12 minutes long. We have a tight schedule, so at 12 minutes we will ask that you wrap up your talk. There will be a panel discussion after your session, during which participants will be able to ask questions. 

#### Poster Presentations
Your poster should be a maximum of 60” x 40” (1.5 m x 1 m). We do not have printers at Pack Forest, so you must print your poster prior to arriving.

__Dr. Rachel White__
> Early Career Scientist Keynote Speaker

[Dr. Rachel White](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/rachelwhite) is an atmospheric scientist in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of British Columbia. She uses a lens of atmospheric dynamics to answer questions ranging from the applied: how does atmospheric circulation contribute to extreme weather, and how might this change with anthropogenic climate change? to the downright theoretical: how would atmospheric circulation be different if the World rotated in the opposite direction? Following the hiking adage that ‘not all who wander are lost’, her academic career in atmospheric and ocean sciences has meandered somewhat, both geographically and conceptually, from her Ph.D. origins in the UK studying how to improve streamflow simulation in regional climate models, through post-doc positions on regional ocean modeling and then semi-idealized atmospheric dynamics at the University of Washington, to a Marie-Curie post-doc fellowship in Barcelona, Spain, studying atmospheric waveguides and extreme heat events, before arriving the University of British Columbia to start her faculty position here.
